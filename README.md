# ML_Final_Project

Collaborated with JP Edralin and Ethan Zang

Using machine learning applications, we analyzed three different natured datasets (imaging, text, time-series) taken from Kaggle and the UCI Machine Learning repository. Through a series of pre-processing, feature extraction, implementation of classifiers, and performance analysis, we were able to solve classification and clustering problems. This was done using Scikit-learn, Pandas, and NumPy ML tools in Python.
