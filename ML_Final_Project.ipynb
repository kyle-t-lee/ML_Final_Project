Performance metrics of accuracy and f1-score were recorded for this classifier."

For each iteration/combination of the folds (there are 5 in total), we first perform PCA on the data. To do so, we first center the data to have a mean of zero and a variance of 1. We then perform PCA using 90% as our threshold; in other words, we aim to reduce our data to have k features, where k is the number of components that captures 90% of the energy. At this point, we use the Gradient Descent classifier to classify our data samples using a one vs. all multiclass approach, and we record the accuracy and f1-score as performance metrics for the classifier."

For this particular iteration, we apply K-Means Clustering using the Cosine Distance Metric. This distance metric essentially measures the cosine of the angle between two vectors and projects it in a multi-dimensional space."

    "Joseph Edralin: Much like the previous two clustering algorithms, we used our custom k-means class KM. KM took in the number of desired clusters and distance metric as parameters, which in this case were 5 and 'cityblock', respectively. The cityblock distance metric, which involves rectilinear distance, takes the sum of the absolute differences of the coordinates of the points being compared. For example, if Point A had the coordinates (3,8) and Point B had the coordinates (9,17), the city block distance would be d = |(17-8)| + |(9-3)| = 15."
